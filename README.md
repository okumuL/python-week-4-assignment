# File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️ + Error Handling Lab 🧪

## Description
This project demonstrates:
1. How to **read** a file and create a modified version of it.
2. How to **handle errors** when a file does not exist or cannot be read.

The program:
- Asks the user for a filename.
- Reads the file’s contents.
- Modifies the content (by converting all text to uppercase).
- Writes the modified content into a new file prefixed with `modified_`.
